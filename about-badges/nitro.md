# Where is Nitro?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Discord's API does not allow me to receive the Nitro status of an user. The requested user would have to authorize Discord.ID \(Oauth2, _like when you add a Bot_\) in order to get the information.
{% endhint %}

### Hint

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Early Supporter` badge is shown on discord.id if the user had Nitro before `October 10th, 2018`.
{% endhint %}
