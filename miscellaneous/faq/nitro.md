# Where is Nitro?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Discord's API does not allows me to receive the Nitro-Status of a user. The requested user would have to authorize Discord.ID \(Oauth2, _like when you add a Bot_\) in order to get the information.
{% endhint %}

### Hint

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Early Supporter` Badge is shown on discord.id when the user had Nitro before `October 10th, 2018`.
{% endhint %}
