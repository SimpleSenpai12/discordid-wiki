## Will there be a way to track users in a server?

* No. This is not supported by Discord and also against a core value of mine: **Privacy**. 

## Will there be a way to get details such as Server Logo, Server Icon?

* No. Beiside some technical impossiblities, it's not what discord.id should be about.

## Will there be a way to lookup users by username?

* No. This is technically not possible nor supported by Discord.
