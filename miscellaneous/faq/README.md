# FAQ

## Will there be a way to track users in a server?

* No. This is not supported by Discord and also against a core value of mine: **Privacy**. 

## Will there be a way to get details such as Server Logo, Server Icon?

* No. Beside some technical impossiblities, it's not what discord.id should be about.

## Will there be a way to lookup users by username?

* No. This is technically not possible nor supported by Discord.

### Where is Nitro?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Discord's API does not allow me to receive the Nitro status of a user. The requested user would have to authorize Discord.ID \(Oauth2, _like when you add a Bot_\) in order to get the information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Early Supporter` badge is shown on discord.id if the user had Nitro before `October 10th, 2018`.
{% endhint %}
