# FAQ

### Where is Nitro?

* **Short answer**: ****Inaccessible
* **Long answer**: Discord's API does not allows me to receive the Nitro-Status of a user. The requested user would have to authorize Discord.ID \(Oauth2, _like when you add a Bot_\) in order to get the information.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Early Supporter` Badge is shown on discord.id when the user had Nitro before `October 10th, 2018`.

## Will there be a way to track users in a server?

* No. This is not supported by Discord and also against a core value of mine: **Privacy**. 

## Will there be a way to get details such as Server Logo, Server Icon?

* No. Beiside some technical impossiblities, it's not what discord.id should be about.

## Will there be a way to lookup users by username?

* No. This is technically not possible nor supported by Discord.

## Is there an API?

* [Yes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#get-user).
